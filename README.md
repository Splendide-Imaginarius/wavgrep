# WavGrep

WavGrep searches a folder of your choice for audio files that are similar to an audio file you choose. It works using statistical cross-correlation.

If you have a small audio file (perhaps ripped from a game or a movie, perhaps not the entire source track), you know what composers might have worked on it, you don't know the track title, and you have those composers' discography available, WavGrep can help you search for the matching track.

In addition to finding exact matches, WavGrep can sometimes surface related-but-not-identical tracks. For example, it can sometimes find an acoustic mix of a rock track.
